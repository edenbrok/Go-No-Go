# Handover Report / Go-No-Go

This repository contains the work I did during one year of PhD research at the Faculty of Technology, Policy and Management at TPM. There are two main documents - the first is the draft of my Go/No-Go Document as of July 2020. This doc can be compiled using the Main.tex file.
The second document is the Hand-Over Report(.tex) I wrote when I left the TU, to consilidate what I had done thus far. There's overlap in the two, but the Go/No-Go document focusses more on possible research approaches and metamodelling, whereas the Hand-Over Report focusses on providing a conceptual model.


The bib file is used in both of the documents. It includes way more references than used in the documents - basically everything I came across and that sounded vaguely interesting and relevant. If you open it using JabRef, it sorts some of the references into categories. For a little more organisation, I've also added my Endnote library file in which all the references are at least sorted into categories.

Finally, I've included a zip with summaries of articles I made while writing my literature review. Some of them are very minimal, others very elaborate (based on how interesting I thought they were), but hopefully they are helpful for someone.
