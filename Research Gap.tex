\section{Research Gap}

\subsection{Influence of included \& contextual factors}
%I.e. platform infrastructure, different social networks, critical thinking skills of the individual, value/context of the information
\subsection{Variety of plausible theoretical explanations}
%Psychological mechanisms as well as societal effects. Effect shown by modelling studies
\subsection{Lack of overview on sociotechnical system level}
%what do I mean by the sociotechnical system?
%most empirical studies only consider one perspective
%modelling studies tend to isolate the mechanism or behaviour of interest
