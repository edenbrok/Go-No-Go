\section{Methodology}

\subsection{Defining the purpose, scope and criterea of the metamodel}
%design science?
%what will I "measure" in the model? (what are my objectives)

\subsection{Finding the elements of the metamodel through case-study based simulation modelling}
%case studies with mixed methods
%simulation modelling using ABM

\subsection{Analysing the importance and sensitivity of metamodel elemenys}
%both intra and inter model exploratory analysis
%for example: how much do design choices of the SMP matter? 

\subsection{Evaluation of the metamodel}
%does it meet its purpose
%what do my findings say about the real world?
